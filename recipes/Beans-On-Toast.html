<strong><em>Beans on Toast Ingredients</em></strong>
<ul>
    <li>Baked Beans</li>
    <li>2 Slices of Bread</li>
    <li>1-2 Teaspoons of Butter</li>
    <li>Pinch of Salt & Black Pepper</li>
</ul>

<strong><em>Steps</em></strong>
<ol>
    <li>Warm the beans: Pour the baked beans into a small saucepan and heat gently over medium heat. Stir occasionally until hot throughout — about 4–5 minutes. Don’t let them boil, or they might dry out.</li>
    <li>Toast the bread: While the beans are heating, toast your bread slices to your liking — golden and crisp is perfect.</li>
    <li>Butter it up: Spread a thin layer of butter on the hot toast for that extra richness.</li>
    <li>Top and season: Spoon the warm beans evenly over the toast, then season with a pinch of salt and black pepper.</li>
</ol>
