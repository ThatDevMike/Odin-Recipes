        <h4><strong><em>Jollof Rice Dish</em></strong></h4>
    <p>Jollof Rice is more than just a meal in Ghana — it’s a celebration of flavor, culture, and togetherness. Every pot tells a story, filled with rich spices, vibrant colors, and the unmistakable aroma that brings people straight to the table. Ghanaian Jollof stands out for its depth of taste and the love that goes into every stir.</p>

    <p>The secret to that authentic Ghanaian flavor lies in two things: the gentle stirring of the pot and a touch of shrimp powder. That small but mighty ingredient enhances the taste, giving the rice its signature richness and depth. It’s the final touch that makes Ghanaian Jollof the real deal — a dish that proudly carries the soul of West Africa.</p>

    <strong><em>Ingredients</em></strong>
    <ul>
        <li>Chopped Tin Red Tomato</li>
        <li>Tomatoe Puree</li>
        <li>Tilda Rice</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Cloves</li>
        <li>Oil</li>
        <li>Shrimp Powder</li>
        <li>Pepper</li>
	<li>Three Onions</li>
        
    </ul>

   <strong><em>Steps</strong></em>

<ol>
  <li>Use three onions in total. Cut one onion in half and add one half to 
the oil along with two black cloves. Fry them together to infuse the oil 
with a rich, aromatic flavor.</li>

  <li>Once the oil is fragrant, add one whole tube of tomato puree and 
stir well to combine.</li>

  <li>Blend the remaining two and a half onions with two garlic cloves, 
one and a half habanero peppers, two cans of chopped tomatoes, and one 
black clove. Blend until smooth.</li>

  <li>Add the blended tomato mixture to the oil. Season with salt and a 
pinch of shrimp powder. Let the stew simmer until well-cooked and the oil 
begins to separate from the sauce. Then, add five cups of Tilda rice and 
cook on low heat, stirring occasionally until the rice is tender and 
infused with all the flavors.</li>
</ol>
